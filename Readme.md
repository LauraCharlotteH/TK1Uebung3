this is the solution for group 20


In case of Ant failure please do the following:

1.open project in eclipse or any other development environment

2. in src/com.group20.endpoint
	rightclick on EndpointPublisher.java
	> run as
	> java application
(this starts the server side do that only once after opening IDE 
the second and third time will throw errors as it is already running!) 

3. in src/com.group20.clientSOAP
	rightclick on ticketClientSOAP.java
	> run as
	> java application
(this starts the client and can be done how ever often one wants to)
